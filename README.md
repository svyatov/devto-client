An unofficial, zero-dependency TypeScript client for the [dev.to (Forem) v1 API](https://developers.forem.com/api/v1). Every endpoint typed, every correctness trap handled by default.

The raw API punishes hand-rollers. Forget the versioned Accept header and your requests silently downgrade to the deprecated v0 API, which returns different shapes. Miss the undocumented rate limits and you get plain-text 429s your JSON parser chokes on. This client bakes the fixes in so you can't reach for the wrong thing.

## Install

```sh
npm install devto-client
```

Node 22.12 or newer, ESM only. CommonJS projects on Node 22.12+ can load it with `require()` thanks to `require(esm)`.

## Quickstart

```ts
import { DevToClient } from "devto-client";

const devto = new DevToClient(); // public endpoints need no key

const articles = await devto.articles.list({ tag: "typescript", per_page: 3 });
for (const article of articles) {
  console.log(article.title, article.url); // fully typed, autocomplete included
}
```

That's a real request against dev.to. The response type comes from Forem's own OpenAPI spec, so `article.` in your editor lists exactly what the server sends.

Every method follows one call shape: required path ids come first as positional arguments (`articles.get(123)`, `articles.getByPath("ben", "my-slug")`), then everything else (query params or body fields) goes in a single flat object, then an optional `{ signal }` for aborting. You never say whether a value travels as a path, query, or body slot; that's the client's job. The parameter names in your editor are the real ones, generated from the spec, so `getByPath` autocompletes as `(username, slug)`, not `(arg0, arg1)`.

## What's covered

Each property on the client is a resource namespace, and the tier column tells you what credentials it needs before you write the code:

| Namespace | Covers | Tier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `devto.articles` | Read, search, publish, and manage your own drafts via the `me` operations | public / api-key |
| `devto.comments` | Comment threads on articles and podcast episodes | public |
| `devto.users` | User profiles, plus moderation actions | public / moderator |
| `devto.organizations` | Organizations, their members, and their articles | public |
| `devto.followers` | The users following you | api-key |
| `devto.follows` | Create a follow and list the tags you follow | api-key |
| `devto.tags` | The instance's tags | public |
| `devto.readinglist` | Your saved-articles reading list | api-key |
| `devto.podcastEpisodes` | Published podcast episodes | public |
| `devto.videos` | Articles published with a video | public |
| `devto.profileImages` | A user's profile-image URLs, looked up by username | public |
| `devto.reactions` | Create or toggle reactions | admin |
| `devto.instance` | Metadata for the connected Forem instance | public |
| `devto.subforems` | Sub-communities on the instance | public |
| `devto.healthChecks` | App, cache, and database liveness probes | public |
| `devto.trends` | Trends and their articles | public |
| `devto.surveys` | Surveys and their poll results | api-key |
| `devto.concepts` | Concepts and their articles | public |
| `devto.agentSessions` | Agent sessions, plus the undocumented presign and raw-url helpers | api-key |
| `devto.badges` | Badge definitions; mutations need admin | public / admin |
| `devto.badgeAchievements` | Badges awarded to users; awarding needs admin | public / admin |
| `devto.billboards` | Billboards (display ads) | admin |
| `devto.pages` | Static instance pages; mutations need admin | public / admin |
| `devto.segments` | Audience segments and their membership | admin |
| `devto.recommendedArticlesLists` | Recommended-articles lists | api-key |
| `devto.analytics` | Analytics for your own content | api-key |
| `devto.feedbackMessages` | Update the status of an abuse/feedback report | moderator |
| `devto.admin.users` | User administration | admin |
| `devto.admin.concepts` | Concept administration | admin |
| `devto.admin.requestRedirects` | Request redirects | admin |

`reactions` looks like a regular user endpoint and isn't: Forem gates it on admin upstream, so an ordinary key gets a 401. The same goes for `articles.unpublish`, which wants a moderator. Anything missing from this table is still reachable through [the escape hatch](#the-escape-hatch) at the bottom.

## Authentication

Grab an API key from dev.to under Settings → Extensions → DEV Community API Keys, and pass it once:

```ts
const devto = new DevToClient({ apiKey: process.env.DEVTO_API_KEY });

const draft = await devto.articles.create({
  title: "Hello from devto-client",
  body_markdown: "Drafted via the API.",
  published: false,
});
console.log(`draft #${draft.id} created`);
```

You pass the article fields flat. On the wire dev.to wants them wrapped in `{ "article": { ... } }`, and the client adds that wrapper for you — one less bit of transport trivia to remember. The key travels in the `api-key` header on every request. The client refuses `http://` base URLs so it can't leak in cleartext (see self-hosted instances below for the escape hatch).

## Pagination

The API paginates with `page` and `per_page` and sends no pagination metadata, so knowing when to stop is your problem. Worse, servers may cap `per_page` below what you asked for, which makes a short page indistinguishable from the last page. The iterator variants handle this for you by walking pages until an empty one:

```ts
for await (const article of devto.articles.listAll({ tag: "devops" })) {
  console.log(article.title);
}
```

Every paginated list gets an `All` twin: `articles.list` / `articles.listAll`, `tags.list` / `tags.listAll`, and so on. The plain methods stay available when you want a single page.

## Errors

Every non-2xx response throws a single error class carrying the HTTP status and whatever the server sent:

```ts
import { DevToApiError } from "devto-client";

try {
  await devto.articles.get(999999999);
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof DevToApiError) {
    console.log(err.status); // 404
    console.log(err.body); // { error: "not found", status: 404 } when the server sends JSON
    console.log(err.rawBody); // raw text otherwise (Rack::Attack's 429 is plain text)
  }
}
```

You might expect every error body to be JSON. It isn't: rate-limit 429s arrive as plain text, and some hand-rolled 400s omit the `status` field. `DevToApiError` covers all three shapes.

## Retries

Rate-limited (429) requests retry automatically for all methods, honoring `Retry-After`, because a 429 means the server never processed the request. Transient 5xx responses retry only for idempotent methods; retrying a failed `POST /articles` could double-publish. Backoff is exponential with jitter, three attempts total by default.

```ts
const devto = new DevToClient({
  apiKey: process.env.DEVTO_API_KEY,
  retry: { attempts: 5, maxDelayMs: 10_000 }, // or retry: false to disable
});
```

A `Retry-After` above `maxDelayMs` throws immediately instead of parking your process; an arbitrary self-hosted instance could otherwise tell you to sleep for an hour. The trailing options argument on every method carries an `AbortSignal` that cancels mid-backoff, not just mid-request:

```ts
const controller = new AbortController();
const promise = devto.articles.get(123, { signal: controller.signal });
controller.abort(); // rejects promptly, even if the client was waiting out a 429
```

Signal lives in that trailing argument, not the params object, so aborting never collides with a real query or body field. For a method whose params are optional, pass `undefined` first: `devto.articles.list(undefined, { signal })`.

There's no `timeout` option, because the platform already has one:

```ts
const article = await devto.articles.get(123, { signal: AbortSignal.timeout(5_000) });
```

Watch the scope, though. That signal covers the whole call, backoff included, so it's a deadline for the entire operation rather than a per-attempt limit. A request that gets 429'd twice will burn most of its five seconds parked in `Retry-After` waits and then give up. If you want each attempt to get its own budget, set `retry: false` and drive the retries yourself.

## Self-hosted Forem instances

The base URL defaults to `https://dev.to` and is configurable:

```ts
const forem = new DevToClient({ baseUrl: "https://community.example.com", apiKey: "..." });
```

Plain `http://` throws at construction unless you opt in with `allowInsecureHttp: true`, which exists for local development against a Forem instance on localhost.

## Custom headers

Every request already carries a versioned Accept header and, when you're authenticated, your api-key. Beyond those you can attach your own defaults. A `user-agent` that identifies your app in dev.to's logs is the usual reason:

```ts
const devto = new DevToClient({
  apiKey: process.env.DEVTO_API_KEY,
  headers: { "user-agent": "my-app/1.0 (+https://my-app.example)" },
});
```

Client-level headers merge into every request, and a per-request header of the same name wins, so you can override a default for a single call:

```ts
await devto.request("GET", "/api/articles/latest", {
  headers: { "user-agent": "my-app/1.0 batch-job" },
});
```

Two headers you can't override, by design. The versioned Accept header always wins, because dropping it silently falls back to the deprecated v0 API. So does the `api-key`, which belongs in the `apiKey` option rather than here; a key smuggled through `headers` skips the guard that refuses redirects so it can't leak off dev.to.

Browsers are the exception. They ignore a `user-agent` set from JavaScript and send their own, so this option only takes effect off the browser.

## Browser usage

Public endpoints (articles, comments, tags, and friends) send `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, so keyless reads work from a browser. Authenticated endpoints deliberately don't: Forem disables CORS on them because the API key is intended for non-browser scripts. Keep keys on a server.

## Rate limits

These are server configuration, not documented API contract, so treat them as guidance that can change without notice. As of mid-2026, dev.to allows roughly 3 GET requests per second and 1 write per second per API key, returning 429 with a `Retry-After` header (which proxies sometimes strip). Admin keys are exempt. The default retry policy absorbs occasional 429s; a sustained crawl needs pacing on your side.

## Types you can import

Hover `devto.articles.get(1)` and your editor shows `Promise<Article>` instead of a path-indexed blob you have to decode. Every result backed by a real schema has a friendly name, and every one of those names is importable:

```ts
import type { Article, ArticleSummary, User } from "devto-client";

function render(article: Article) {
  /* … */
}
```

These are plain 1:1 aliases over the spec schemas. `Article` is exactly the `ArticleShow` schema; `ArticleSummary` is the lighter `ArticleIndex` that the list endpoints return. There's no merged god-type here, and no hand-written shape that can drift from the server. When the spec changes the alias changes with it, so a mismatch is a build error rather than a silent lie.

Method params get names too. `articles.search` takes `ArticleSearchParams`, `articles.create` takes `ArticleCreateParams`, and they hover as a flat field list instead of an `Omit<…> & {…}` intersection you'd have to squint at. You won't usually import these by hand, since you pass the fields as a plain object and let inference do the naming. When you do want the type itself, to annotate a wrapper function for instance, reach for it through the `DevTo` namespace below (`DevTo.ArticleSearchParams`), which is where the param names live.

A few schema names collide with browser globals. `Comment` is a DOM node, `RequestRedirect` is a fetch mode, and flat-importing either would shadow the real one. Those live only under the `DevTo` namespace, which is the collision-free home for every alias:

```ts
import type { DevTo } from "devto-client";

function reply(comment: DevTo.Comment) {
  /* … */
}
```

`DevTo.*` reaches every friendly name, colliding or not, so lean on it whenever a bare import would be ambiguous.

## How the types are made

Types generate from Forem's own rswag spec (`swagger/v1/api_v1.json`, pinned in [`spec/api_v1.json`](spec/api_v1.json)) composed with [`spec/overlay.json`](spec/overlay.json), a list of corrections where the upstream spec is missing schemas or disagrees with what the server actually sends. Each overlay entry records why it exists, which makes the spec-vs-reality gap machine-readable and each entry a candidate PR to Forem. A daily CI job diffs the pinned snapshot against upstream — structurally, so it names which path templates and operations changed — and flags any recorded fixture that has aged past its freshness window, filing an issue with the exact re-record command for each affected fixture. From there you re-record live responses from dev.to on demand, one endpoint at a time, instead of on a weekly schedule that dev.to's per-IP throttling made flaky; a manual reality-check run still type-checks fresh recordings against the spec, catching the server drifting under an unchanged spec.

## Deviations from the upstream spec

The call surface is ergonomic, but the core stays faithful to the server: response types mirror what dev.to actually sends, not what the docs claim, and every deviation is explicit. The full machine-readable list is [`spec/overlay.json`](spec/overlay.json); the highlights:

| Kind | What | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Included, undocumented | `agentSessions.presign` (`POST /api/agent_sessions/presign`) | Exists in Forem's routes, absent from the spec. Marked `undocumented` in its [operation table](src/resources/agent-sessions.ts). |
| Included, undocumented | `agentSessions.rawUrl` (`GET /api/agent_sessions/{id}/raw_url`) | Same. |
| Excluded | listings endpoints | Dead upstream stubs returning empty responses. |
| Excluded | `/api/display_ads` | Transitional alias of `/api/billboards`. |
| Excluded | `suspended` user-role alias | Alias of `suspend`. |
| Excluded | `GET /api/followers/organizations` | The route exists but the controller action doesn't. Calling it 404s. |
| Privilege-gated | `POST /api/reactions`, `POST /api/reactions/toggle` | Admin-gated upstream despite looking like regular user endpoints; ordinary keys get 401. |
| Privilege-gated | `PUT /api/articles/{id}/unpublish` | Moderator-gated; ordinary keys get 401. |
| Quirk | `GET /api/users/me` | Has been observed intermittently returning 401 on dev.to with a valid key that authenticates elsewhere. |
| Corrected | duplicate `page` param on `GET /api/comments` | The spec declares it twice; the overlay removes the inline copy. |
| Corrected | `POST /api/reactions` responses | The controller returns 201 for newly created reactions; the spec only declares 200. |
| Added schemas | 50 or so response schemas | The upstream spec declares many 2xx responses with no schema at all, including `POST /api/articles`. The overlay fills them from the verified controller/view sources, each entry citing where. |
| Typed `unknown` | all `/api/analytics/*` responses, `PATCH /api/feedback_messages/{id}` | Shapes are produced by service objects, undocumented, and not verifiable without a qualifying account. Honest `unknown` beats a guessed interface. |

Fixture-backed tests verify recorded reality for the public and user-scope tiers. Admin, moderation, and analytics responses can't be recorded with a low-privilege account, so their types derive from the composed spec and carry the unverified caveat above.

## The documented verb, nothing else

Rails accepts PUT and PATCH interchangeably on update routes. The client exposes only the verb the spec documents for each endpoint (`articles.update` is PUT, `concepts.update` is PATCH). The ergonomic surface reshapes how you _call_ an endpoint; it never invents endpoints or verbs the spec doesn't have.

## The escape hatch

When you need an endpoint the typed surface doesn't cover, or want to send a request exactly your way, drop to the raw transport:

```ts
const controller = new AbortController();
const raw = await devto.request<unknown>("GET", "/api/articles/latest", {
  query: { page: 1 },
  signal: controller.signal,
});
```

`client.request(method, path, opts)` still layers on the versioned header, auth, retries, and error handling — it only hands you back control over the path and payload. It's the one place the `{ query, body, signal }` options object survives, precisely because a raw call has no spec to derive its shape from.
